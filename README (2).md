# 🤖 AI Text Generator

A simple and interactive web-based AI Text Generator built using Python,
Streamlit, and Hugging Face Transformers. The application allows users
to enter a sentence or short prompt and generate AI-based text using a
pretrained language model.

## 📌 About the Project

This project demonstrates how an AI language model can be integrated
into a simple and user-friendly web application.

The application uses the **Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct** pretrained model
from Hugging Face to generate text based on the user's input. Streamlit
is used to create the interactive web interface.

This project was developed as a practical project to understand the
basics of Generative AI, Transformer models, and AI-powered web
applications.

## ✨ Features

-   📝 Simple text prompt input
-   🤖 AI-generated text
-   ⚡ Interactive web interface
-   🔄 Generate different responses for different prompts
-   🎨 Customized Streamlit interface
-   🧠 Pretrained Transformer model
-   💾 Model caching for faster interaction
-   📱 Easy-to-use application

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

-   Python
-   Streamlit
-   Hugging Face Transformers
-   PyTorch
-   Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct

## 🔄 How It Works

``` text
User enters a prompt
        ↓
Streamlit receives the input
        ↓
AI language model processes the input
        ↓
The model generates text
        ↓
Generated text is displayed to the user
```

## 🧠 AI Model

This project uses the following pretrained model:

**Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct**

The model is accessed through the Hugging Face Transformers library and
is used for text generation based on the user's prompt.

## ⚙️ Installation

### 1. Install Python

Make sure Python is installed on your computer.

### 2. Install Required Libraries

Open the terminal in the project folder and run:

``` bash
pip install streamlit transformers torch
```

## ▶️ Run the Application

Run the following command in the terminal:

``` bash
streamlit run text_generator.py
```

After running the command, Streamlit will provide a local URL where the
application can be opened in a web browser.

Usually, it will be:

``` text
http://localhost:8501
```

## 💡 Example

Enter a prompt such as:

``` text
Artificial Intelligence is
```

The application will generate text based on the given prompt.

The generated response may vary between different runs because the model
generates text dynamically.

## 🎯 What This Project Demonstrates

This project provides practical experience with:

-   Generative AI concepts
-   Transformer-based language models
-   Hugging Face Transformers
-   Pretrained AI models
-   Text generation
-   Python programming
-   Streamlit web application development
-   Integrating an AI model with a web interface

## ⚠️ Note

The generated text may sometimes be incomplete, repetitive, or
inaccurate. The application is mainly intended for learning,
experimentation, and demonstration purposes.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

The project can be enhanced in the future by adding:

-   🌡️ Temperature control
-   🔢 Maximum token control
-   🔄 Clear or reset option
-   📥 Download generated text
-   🕘 Prompt history
-   🤖 Multiple AI model selection
-   💬 Chat-style interface
-   🎨 Additional UI customization
